      <title>Tackling Biases In or Using Generative AI @ JSIC&#39;24</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/event/jsic/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2024 08:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/event/jsic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I am focusing on several methods based on data perturbation to detect biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We have observed cases where these systems leverage gender, race, or even socioeconomic class information inappropriately for task resolution. Instead of employing real causal reasoning, they often rely on spurious correlations—a phenomenon commonly referred to as bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will demystify the concept of bias, explaining why biases are ubiquitous, why they can sometimes be useful, and proposing a method to detect harmful biases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we will introduce a method we developed to detect biases in LLMs toward different countries using the most common names as proxies. Our findings reveal very negative biases toward certain countries, using widely utilized open-source classifiers for social media analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the same multilingual model tends to favor names from countries that speak the language of the sentence—a phenomenon we call AI Xenophobia. This phenomenon has significant social implications. Our study, which examined the perplexity of language models and classifier outputs, shows that the model reacts differently to completely unknown languages compared to familiar ones and exhibits similar behavior toward names as it does with unfamiliar languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we present a method to mitigate biases in Vision-Language Models, particularly in image captioning models. By perturbing the training data through data augmentation with a Text-to-Image generative model, we enhance variability in the dataset. This approach not only reduces gender bias but also improves the model&amp;rsquo;s performance in tasks such as counting objects and detecting colors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>WASSA Workshop @ ACL 24</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/event/wassa24/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/event/wassa24/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are orgnizing the 14th edition of the WASSA workshop this year at &lt;a href=&#34;https://2024.aclweb.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ACL24&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our keynote speaker will be Debora Nozza&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;flex justify-center	&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://workshop-wassa.github.io/assets/images/debora_nozza.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of hate speech on social media platforms has been rising, with (pseudo-)anonymity allowing individuals to target others without being recognized or easily traced. While this societal issue has garnered significant attention in the NLP community, it presents three major challenges. Hate speech detection models need to be fair, work across all languages, and incorporate personalization while balancing privacy concerns. Addressing these challenges will revolutionize the field of hate speech detection and contribute to the development of a “universal” model that can adapt to individual user perspectives. In this talk, I will present my contributions in this area along with my perspectives on future directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;bio&#34;&gt;Bio&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debora Nozza is an Assistant Professor in Computing Sciences at Bocconi University. Her research interests mainly focus on Natural Language Processing, specifically on the detection and counter-acting of hate speech and algorithmic bias on Social Media data in multilingual context&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-wassa&#34;&gt;About WASSA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of WASSA 2024 is to bring together researchers working on Subjectivity, Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Detection and Classification and their applications to other NLP or real-world tasks (e.g. public health messaging, fake news, media impact analysis, social media mining, computational literary studies) and researchers working on interdisciplinary aspects of affect computation from text. For this edition, we encourage the submission of long and short research and demo papers including, but not restricted to the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resources for subjectivity, sentiment, emotion and social media analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opinion retrieval, extraction, categorization, aggregation and summarization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humor, Irony and Sarcasm detection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mis- and disinformation analysis and the role of affective attributes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aspect and topic-based sentiment and emotion analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analysis of stable traits of social media users, incl. personality analysis and profiling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer learning for domain, language and genre portability of sentiment analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modelling commonsense knowledge for subjectivity, sentiment or emotion analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improvement of NLP tasks using subjectivity and/or sentiment analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of subjectivity and/or sentiment analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The role of emotions in argument mining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application of theories from related fields to subjectivity and sentiment analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multimodal emotion detection and classification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applications of sentiment and emotion mining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public sentiments and communication patterns of public health emergencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past years we have noticed that WASSA offers a platform to researchers investigating sentiment and emotion in lesser-resourced languages. The 2023 edition featured work on no less than 23 different languages and two papers specifically targeted multilingual emotion detection. We wish to continue these efforts as we find it important to consider and publish advances in any language as this helps to underline the wealth of our research community and to diminish the dominance of English-language research. To this purpose we propose a Special track on multilinguality and social bridge between high- and lesser-resourced languages/communities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are orgnizing the 13th edition of the WASSA workshop this year at &lt;a href=&#34;https://2023.aclweb.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ACL23&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our keynote speakers will be David Jurgens and Emily Öhman&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-social-dimensions-of-communication-how-context-shapes-language-use-and-interpretation&#34;&gt;The Social Dimensions of Communication: How Context Shapes Language Use and Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NLP studies of communication often focus on the individual: What we say, when we say it, and how we say it. Yet, the larger social context beyond the individual also plays an important role in our communication — just think of things you can say to your friends but not your parents. How does the social context influence our communication style and content? In this talk, I will describe recent work from my group studying the influence of this context by examining how we choose who to communicate with, how we interpret messages, and how we phrase messages. Across these studies, I will motivate a causal approach for NLP when studying communication behavior to move beyond descriptive analyses to more precise estimates of the effects of social context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;bio&#34;&gt;Bio&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Jurgens is an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Information where he leads the Blablablab. He holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of California, Los Angeles. His research focuses on the intersection between NLP and computational social science venues and has won the Cozzarelli Prize, Cialdini Prize, best paper at ICWSM and W-NUT, and best paper nomination at ACL and Web Science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;affective-datafication-of-narratives-measuring-affect-emotion-and-mood-in-literary-texts&#34;&gt;Affective Datafication of Narratives: measuring affect, emotion, and mood in literary texts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of affect, emotion, and mood - despite the distinct nuances each term holds - often becomes blurred, leading to a usage that is almost interchangeable, particularly within sentiment analysis and NLP. In contrast, traditional fields such as literary studies hold on to more rigid definitions of these terms and how they are understood both in theory and practice. This can easily foster a disconnect between emerging fields such as computational literary studies and the more established qualitative counterparts. This disconnect unfortunately hinders the free exchange of innovative research ideas and methodologies. This talk aims to bridge this gap, highlighting the unique roles of affect, emotion, and mood in narratives and how we can attempt to robustly measure them. We will delve into the interplay of these terms, exploring how they shape and are shaped by authors, readers, and researchers focusing on the operationalization and translation involved in the analysis of emotion-laden phenomena. This exploration will underscore the need for a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding, encouraging synergy between tradition and innovation in emotion detection in general and literary research in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;bio-1&#34;&gt;Bio&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Öhman is currently a tenure-track Assistant professor of Digital Humanities at Waseda University. She received her PhD in Language Technology from the University of Helsinki, where her work centered on building multilingual emotion detection resources for downstream tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her research interests lie within digital humanities and NLP, more specifically sentiment analysis and emotion detection, often doing collaborations with various disciplines such as history, literature, and political science. Her recent projects have focused on negative emotions in literature using affect as a proxy for the literary concept of mood and most recently contrasting the semantic spaces of shame and guilt in Japanese and English social media posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-wassa&#34;&gt;About WASSA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of WASSA 2023 is to bring together researchers working on Subjectivity, Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Detection and Classification and their applications to other NLP or real-world tasks (e.g. public health messaging, fake news, media impact analysis, social media mining, computational literary studies) and researchers working on interdisciplinary aspects of affect computation from text.

&lt;li&gt;Mis- and disinformation analysis and the role of affective attributes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aspect and topic-based sentiment and emotion analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analysis of stable traits of social media users, incl. personality analysis and profiling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer learning for domain, language and genre portability of sentiment analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modelling commonsense knowledge for subjectivity, sentiment or emotion analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improvement of NLP tasks using subjectivity and/or sentiment analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of subjectivity and/or sentiment analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The role of emotions in argument mining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application of theories from related fields to subjectivity and sentiment analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multimodal emotion detection and classification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applications of sentiment and emotion mining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public sentiments and communication patterns of public health emergencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We furthermore encourage submissions to the special theme Ethics in Affective Computing, including opinion papers, as well as experimental papers. This includes the following topics, but is not limited to them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which properties of a model render a automatic analysis task unethical?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which characteristics of an annotation task are to be considered in ethical considerations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are appropriate methods to analyze data and models from an ethical perspective?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What aspects are particular important for affective analysis tasks, in contrast to other NLP settings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
