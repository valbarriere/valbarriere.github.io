### All the different classes can be found [here](../../minerias)! 

This is the CC5205 course from the Universidad de Chile. I restructured it so that it is more adapted to nowadays techniques and more machine learning oriented, it is heavily based on [scikit](https://scikit-learn.org/)! 

Here's a summary: 
1. **General introduction**: Definitions of Data Mining, Data Science, and content of the class
2. **Data**: (Un)structured data, Representation, Normalization, Noise removal, ... 
3. **Data Exploration**: Basic statistics for data exploration.
4. **Intro to Supervised Learning**: Basics of Machine Learning and supervised learning.
5. **[TODO] Intro to Fairness and Biases**: How to avoid making bad models.
6. **Linear Models**: A very simple model, which is the base of deep neural networks!
7. **[TODO] Classifiers**: KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Boosting, Bagging, Random Forests.
8. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis, Independant Component Analysis, t-SNE, UMAP,... 
9. **Clustering methods**: Clustering methods and associated metrics 
10. **SVM, SVR**: Hinge loss, Lagrangian, KKT conditions, non-linear SVM, Kernel trick, SV Regressor  
11. **Introduction to Neural Nets**: Basics of Deep Learning
12. **Introduction to NLP** (Invited Speaker: Juan Jose Alegria): How to deal with natural language.
