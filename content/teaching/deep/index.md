### All the different classes can be found [here](../../deep-index)! 

This is the CC66204 course from the Universidad de Chile. Based on the class of [Ivan Sipiran](https://github.com/ivansipiran), I added details in each of the classes, allowing to understand on how we get to the recent large multimodal models. The github is [here](https://github.com/valbarriere/CC6204-Deep-Learning/).
