We are creating an AI system for nation-wide agricultural production monitoring based on crowd-sourced and remote-sensing.

#### My role

**I am the Director of this project**, which is a collaboration between the University of Chile, (the Centre of Artificial Intelligence)[https://www.cenia.cl], (the Center of Natural Ressources)[https://www.ciren.cl] as principal institutions, and the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.eurocrops.tum.de/), the [European Commission's Joint Research Center](https://www.jrc.eu.todo), and the [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch). 

This is a 4 years [*Tecnologia Avanzada*](https://anid.cl/concursos/concurso-idea-id-tecnologias-avanzadas-2024/) project with a total budget of 956.550.000,00 CLP (footnote ~ a million dollars), 660.000.000,00 coming as funding from the National Research and Development Agency (ANID). 

### The project

This project aims to develop a crop map (like land-use but for crop i.e., which crop are cultivated where) at the country-level. To this aim we will leverage the capacity of general purpose model that we will trained over Chile. This is quite fun as Chile is a very long country with many different climates, making it the perfect place to test a model claiming to be general. 

The objectives are: 
* Gathering existing general crop data at the polygon- and pixel-level from open-source and in-house datasets
* Collecting Chilean crop data at the polygon- and pixel-level, including yield
* Implementing a parcel delineation model, with a polygon-level crop classifier
* Pre-training a large vision model on Worldwide, South American, and Chilean multimodal and multiresolution data
* Train the model to learn to learn various tasks using meta-learning algorithms
* Implement a dashboard using the model's predictions
