# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: StandUp4AI is a new multimodal dataset for humor detection, featuring over 330 hours of stand-up comedies in seven languages. This dataset surpasses existing ones in size and diversity, and experiments show it's a valuable resource for training models, with potential for improved performance when combined with enhanced audio speech recognition methods.
