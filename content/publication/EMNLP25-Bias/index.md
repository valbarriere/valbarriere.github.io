abstract: "Numerous datasets have been proposed to evaluate social bias in Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. However, assessing bias within specific application domains remains challenging, as existing approaches often face limitations in scalability and domain adaptability. In this work, we introduce a domain-adaptive framework that utilizes prompting with Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically transform template-based bias datasets into domain-specific variants. We apply our method to two widely used benchmarks‚Äî\textit{Equity Evaluation Corpus} (EEC) and  \textit{Identity Phrase Templates Test Set} (IPTTS)‚Äîadapting them to the Twitter and Wikipedia Talk data. Our results show that the adapted datasets yield bias estimates more closely aligned with real-world data. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based prompting as a domain-sensitive approach for bias evaluation in NLP systems."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: StandUp4AI is a new multimodal dataset for humor detection, featuring over 330 hours of stand-up comedies in seven languages. This dataset surpasses existing ones in size and diversity, and experiments show it's a valuable resource for training models, with potential for improved performance when combined with enhanced audio speech recognition methods.
