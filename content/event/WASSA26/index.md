summary: Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment & Social Media Analysis.
abstract: 'Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis has become a highly developed research area, ranging from binary classification of reviews to the detection of complex emotion structures between entities found in text. This field has expanded both on a practical level, finding numerous successful applications in business, as well as on a theoretical level, allowing researchers to explore more complex research questions related to affective computing. Its continuing importance is also shown by the interest it generates in other disciplines such as Economics, Sociology, Psychology, Marketing, Crisis Management & Digital Humanities, where it can support the study of online interactions, group dynamics, and public discourse.'

We are orgnizing the 15th edition of the WASSA workshop this year at [EACL26](https://2026.eacl.org/)!  

You can [visit our website](https://workshop-wassa.github.io/).

## About WASSA 

The aim of WASSA 2026 is to bring together researchers working on Subjectivity, Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Detection and Classification and their applications to other NLP or real-world tasks (e.g. public health messaging, fake news, media impact analysis, social media mining, computational literary studies) and researchers working on interdisciplinary aspects of affect computation from text. We encourage the submission of long and short research and demo papers including, but not restricted to the following topics:

* Resources for subjectivity, sentiment, emotion and social media analysis
* Opinion retrieval, extraction, categorization, aggregation and summarization
* Humor, Irony and Sarcasm detection
* Mis- and disinformation analysis and the role of affective attributes
* Aspect and topic-based sentiment and emotion analysis
* Analysis of stable traits of social media users, incl. personality analysis and profiling
* Transfer learning for domain, language and genre portability of sentiment analysis
* Modelling commonsense knowledge for subjectivity, sentiment or emotion analysis
* Improvement of NLP tasks using subjectivity and/or sentiment analysis
* Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of subjectivity and/or sentiment analysis
* Application of theories from related fields to subjectivity and sentiment analysis
* Multimodal emotion detection and classification
* Social Groups analysis and their interactions in Social Media
* Generation, detection, and evaluation of subjectivity, sentiment, and emotion in NLP tasks with LLMs
* Risks, challenges, and ethical implications of affective uses of LLMs
* The role of emotions in argument mining
* Applications of sentiment and emotion mining
* Public sentiments and communication patterns of public health emergencies
* The analysis of pretrained small and large language models

Finally, this year we also propose a special track on **multilinguality and socio-cultural adaptation to lesser-resourced languages/communities**.

In general, we particularly invite contributions from young researchers, work on low-resource languages, multilingual methods, and interdisciplinary work.
